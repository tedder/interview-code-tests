Code tests for interviewing software engineering candidates
===========================================================

This is the start of a repository for coding test problems that can be given to software engineering candidates.


# Undocumented/half-baked ideas

* Some sort of problem that is already in a framework but needs modification to add features. More accuriately resembles real-world.
* Code that checks this repository for licensing information.


# Frequently asked questions

Feel free to ask questions or edit answers to the following.

## Why use take-home code problems?

Take-home problems are a low-pressure way to see if a candidate can actually write code. It's amazing how many interview candidates aren't capable of writing code. It's also amazing how many companies expect candidates to solve complex problems on a whiteboard without access to a search engine, documentation, and other common software resources.

While these problems are typically limited in scope, they not only show if a candidate can write code but also if they solve a complete problem. In other words, they are more than simply a cute or abstract 10-lines-of-code size of problem, without getting into the complexity of a full system. Most candidates on modern agile/lean engineering teams are expected to own a problem's domain from initial understanding through automated acceptance testing.

## When are whiteboard problems effective?

Face-to-face ("whiteboard") style problemsolving is effective to ensure a candidate can identify and pseudocode an algorithm in a reasonable length of time.

## Why share our code problems?
