Reverse a string
================
Given a string, show several ways to reverse the string. In other words, if the string is "hello world!", the output is "!dlrow olloh". There are many ways to implement this, the intent is to show a basic understanding of performance implications and ability to communicate.

## Example

As an example, this command should output anagrams on most platforms, given a dictionary file:

    $ echo "nelson" | python reverse.py
    nelson=noslen
